# Introduction to Computor Vision  OpenCV
##  1. Getting Started with OpenCV 
### Introduction to computer vision 
The difference between Image processing aand computer vision is that in image processing the input is an image
    and the output is also typically an image. Sometimes the output image is an
    improved version of the input image and sometimes it is just a processed version
    of the input image. 
    Similarly we can also think of edge detection as image processing
    because the input is an image and the output is a processed version of the
    image. 
    On the other hand in computer vision the input is an image
    and the output is usually some information. 
    For example, in face  recognition the input is an image and the output is the identity of the person.
    Similarly in object detection, the input is an image and the output is the
    location and labels of objects in image. 
    The main problems trated in computer vision can be rechognised as:
    * Image Processing: image denoising, restoration and 
    
### Basic image operations
